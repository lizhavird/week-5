# ASSESSMENT 4: INTRO TO RUBY
# Coding practical questions

# 1. Use TWO different Ruby methods to return a new array with all the numbers multiplied by 3. Expected output: [3, 6, 18, 27, 9, 63]

myArray = [1, 2, 6, 9, 3, 21]



# 2. Create a method that takes in a sentence and returns a new sentence with the first letter of each word capitalized. Expected output = "Hello There, How Are You?"

sentence = "hello there, how are you?"



# 3. Create a method that takes in a string and returns a new string with all the vowels removed. Expected output = " hv n vwls"

no_vowels = "I have no vowels"



# 4. Look at this horrible Ruby code. Fix it to be good Ruby code.

class example
  constructor(day)
    @day=day
  end

  def SayHi
    if(day === "Friday"){
      puts "TGIF!"
    }
    else if(day === "Monday"){
      puts "Its monday again"
    }
    else{
      puts "another day"
    }
end

# 5a. Create a class called Animal that initializes with a color. Create a method in the class called legs that returns 4.



# 5b. Create a new instance of an Animal with a brown color. Return how the number of legs for the animal object.
